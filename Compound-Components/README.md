# Compound Components with Provide/Inject

Compound component is a component that is made of several tightly coupled related components, that the end users can piece together themselves to get some desired result.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report

```
