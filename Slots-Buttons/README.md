# Vue Slot buttons

Vue button components with slots and class merge example

Note: When using slots to design components like buttons this way, it's interesting to know that Vue will actually combine/merge any class attributes on the component tags with any class attr inside the component's top element. This is really useful when customizing components.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
